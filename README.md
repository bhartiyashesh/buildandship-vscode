# Build & Ship — VS Code Extension

**Deploy from your editor. One click. Zero DevOps.**

You built the app in 20 minutes with AI. Why does deploying it take 2 hours?

Build & Ship gives you Vercel-class deploys on hardware you own. This extension brings that power into your editor.

## Features

- **One-click deploy** — Hit the deploy button, get a live URL in ~30 seconds
- **Project dashboard** — See all your projects, their status, and live URLs
- **Status bar** — Current project status always visible at the bottom
- **Auto-install** — Extension installs the CLI for you if needed
- **GitHub sign-in** — One-click authentication
- **Works everywhere** — VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf

## How It Works

1. Open a project folder
2. Click the Build & Ship icon in the sidebar
3. Click **Deploy**
4. Get a live URL

That's it. We detect your framework, build a container, and deploy it — all on your own hardware.

## Supported Frameworks

Next.js, Remix, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Vite, Express, FastAPI, Django, Flask, Go, Rust, and any project with a Dockerfile. For anything else, our AI generates a Dockerfile automatically.

- Docker (or OrbStack) running on your machine
- That's it
